# Greenhouse Gases Analysis


## Project Summary

The emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) continue to rise at an alarming rate. Without implementing drastic measures, the projected GHG emissions for the year 2100 will surpass 120 billion tonnes, resulting in a temperature increase of over 3°C and exacerbating the adverse effects on our planet.

Initiating mitigation efforts at an earlier stage allows us to implement less drastic measures in reducing emissions and to keep the temperature rise within the target range of the Paris Agreement. The agreement aims to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5-2°C, thereby mitigating the impact on our environment.

The sectors contributing the most to emissions are electricity and heat production, transportation, manufacturing and construction, and agriculture. To minimize our carbon footprint, it is crucial to take necessary actions in these sectors and optimize emission levels.

## Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is obtained from the "Our World In Data" website, which provides reliable and comprehensive information on various global issues, including GHG emissions. The dataset will be used to analyze trends, patterns, and factors influencing GHG emissions across different sectors.
